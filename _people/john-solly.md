As a Geospatial Web3 Developer, I combine GIS domain knowledge and full stack web development to create beautiful (and fast) DApps. John studied GIS under thought leaders (Michael Goodchild, Waldo Tobler, Krzysztof Janowicz, and Dan Montello) while completing a B.A. in Geography at UC Santa Barbara and an M.S. in Geoinformatics and Geospatial Intelligence at George Mason University.
