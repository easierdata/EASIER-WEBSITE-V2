> The EASIER Data Initiative develops decentralized cyberinfrastructure for efficiently, accessibly, and sustainably onloading, analyzing, and extracting large amounts of geospatial data. Concerning onloading, we are building a generalizable pipeline for heterogeneous geospatial data ingress into the Filecoin and IPFS environment.
>
>   
> We aim to facilitate data analysis and extraction to create a streamlined process to bring data off the Filecoin/IPFS network in an actionable and useful capacity. The goal is to design and optimize offloading techniques that are compatible with existing geospatial workflows, integrating with existing standards such as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs), and SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STACs). To solidify the accessible offloading experience, we are creating several approachable client programs in common languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Go.
>
>   
> We anticipate the development of a unified web-access portal for querying and extracting heterogeneous data products and a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) plugin for in-program data retrieval, which will better integrate, consult, and serve a larger community of partners and users across industry, academia, and government.
