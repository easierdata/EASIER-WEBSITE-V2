Partner will use the Project Funds to develop decentralized cyberinfrastructure for efficiently, accessibly, and sustainably onloading, analyzing, and extracting large amounts of spatial data. Concerning onloading, Partner will develop a pipeline that is generalizable for heterogeneous geospatial data ingress into the Filecoin and IPFS environment. Partner will aim to facilitate data analysis and extraction to create a streamlined process to bring data off the Filecoin/IPFS network in an actionable and useful capacity. Partner will work to design and optimize offloading processes that are compatible with existing geospatial workflows, as integrating with existing standards such as Cloud Optimized 

GeoTIFFs(COGs) and SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STACs) will be an essential part of developing advantageous infrastructure. To solidify the accessible offloading experience, Partner will develop several approachable client programs in common languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Go.

Partner anticipates the development of a unified web-access portal for querying and extracting heterogeneous data products and a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) plugin for in-program data retrieval, which will better integrate, consult, and serve a larger community of partners and users across industry, academia, and government.
